<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="p3">Hi, my name is William Cyze but you can call me Billy!
    This is my website for my Introduction to Computer Science class at Lewis University.
    I guess I should tell you a little bit about me. I am a freshman at Lewis University.
    I come from a family of six kids, with me being the third child. I am a very driven
    and hard working individual who loves all technology. While in high school, I joined the robotics
    team, I founded the drone club, was in the sound crew club, worked at the school for three summers, 
    and so much more. I am majoring in Unmanned Aircraft Systems at Lewis University, and I am thinking 
    of possibly a minor in cyber security. I have joined the Lewis University Counter-Strike: Global 
    Offensive E-Sports team, and I hope to join the drone racing team once Covid has passed. If you'd 
    like to find out more about me, you can contact me through my email at the top of the page!

<h4>My Favorite Hobby</h4>
<p class="p4">My favorite hobby is learning about and using new technology. 
    I have loved to work with technology for a very long time. I have been known to dissemble old 
    computers that no longer work to learn about how the internal components work together. This 
    fascination has lead me to learn so much about how computers are put together. I love to expand my 
    knowledge about technology to know how to fix any problems that come up with the technology of my 
    friends and family. My other favorite hobby is flying an airplane. I am currently learning how to 
    fly an airplane in order to get my private pilot's license. Flying is a very liberating and calming 
    experience, since it is just you, the plane, and the sky.
